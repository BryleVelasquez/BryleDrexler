Hello! My name is Bryle Drexler Z. Velasquez, and I’m 18 years old. I have a passion for coding, and I’m proficient in C language, which I’ve been working with for some time. Right now, I’m expanding my skills and learning Java to broaden my programming knowledge. I’m excited about the opportunities ahead and always eager to learn new things in the tech world!
